# The course: "Developing applications using the Spring Framework"

## Lab-01

**On the topic "First acquaintance with the Spring Framework"**


This laboratory work is an introduction to the concept and essence of the Spring Framework. After installing JDK, a
project was created in IDE Intelij IDEA Ultimate. The choice of this IDE was justified by the possibility of full
support of the necessary project. 

- As indicated in the PRD, we needed to create an empty project first, which we actually
did. 
- After that, the phrase "Hello world" was added, which is successfully displayed on the initial page
- Next, according to the task in the control questions, we developed a page for the team and each member of the team, adding additional
information (poems).
